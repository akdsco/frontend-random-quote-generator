# Random Quote Generator

### Request
Build a random quote generator. The quotes should be randomly constructed by assembling different pieces of a sentence. While creating this program, you have to respect following criteria:

- The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each call
- Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments
- The quotes should be relatively coherent
- User can select the number of quotes generated
- User can choose between 2 types of quote generators

### Solution

I created HTML page that displays random quotes. There's HTML form that allows selection and button to generate new quotes. User can choose between two different types of quotes. I used HTML DOM to connect form selection with JavaScript. I used JavaScript to create program logic and store data. Generator selects randomly three different parts of a sentence stored in array and creates a random quote.

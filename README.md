=======================================

Display random quotes using JavaScript

* * *

### Request

Build a random quote generator, which will assemble quotes randomly from different pieces of a sentence. 
While creating this program, you have to respect the following criteria:

- the citations are generated randomly with each call
- each quote is a combination of at least three sentence fragments
- they should be relatively coherent
- user can select the number of quotes generated
- user can choose between 2 types of quotes

### Solution

I created an HTML page that displays random quotes. There's a form that allows selection. User can choose between 
 two different types of citations. I used JavaScript to create program logic and store data.
